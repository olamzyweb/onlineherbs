<!-- Certainly! Below is a basic example of a PHP cart system that starts when a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button. This example assumes you have a basic understanding of HTML and PHP, and a session is used to store the cart data.

### HTML Form (Add to Cart Button)
First, create a form with an "Add to Cart" button. This form will send data to a PHP script to handle the addition of items to the cart.

```html -->
<?php session_start();?>

<!-- ```

### PHP Script (add_to_cart.php)
Next, create the PHP script that processes the form data and adds the item to the cart.

```php -->
<?php


// Check if the cart session variable exists, if not, create it
if (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) {
    $_SESSION['cart'] = array();
}
if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"){
// Get the product details from the form submission
$product_id = $_POST['product_id'];
$product_name = $_POST['product_name'];
$product_price = $_POST['product_price'];
$quantity = $_POST['quantity'];
}

// Check if the product already exists in the cart
if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) {
    // Update the quantity
    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]['quantity'] += $quantity;
} else {
    // Add new product to the cart
    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id] = array(
        'name' => $product_name,
        'price' => $product_price,
        'quantity' => $quantity
    );
}

// Redirect to the cart page
echo 'product added successfully'
// header('Location: products.php');
// exit();
?>
<!-- 
This is a basic implementation. For a production system, you would likely need to add additional features such as updating item quantities, removing items from the cart, and persisting cart data across user sessions or accounts. -->
